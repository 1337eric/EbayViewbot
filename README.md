# EbayViewbot


Proof Of Concept: The more views you have on an eBay listing, the higher it shows while searching for said item in the results

How it works:
- User inputs URL, desired amount of views, and the maximum amount of threads to run at once
- Threads created, UserAgent generated, request made with proxy from list

Does it work?
